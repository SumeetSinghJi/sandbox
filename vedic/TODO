4. Could you possible write in documentation मान is Type Inference. The compiler automatically deduces

Code changes

* Can you use it with cargo? or embed with underlying Rust?
* Can we interface with underlying platform e.g. for windows gui window, or system sleep, or linux arpa for curl
* We need an poll key input for event driven programming
* Can you have a variable in a string e.g. वद("परिणामः " + अ)
* By default all cout vada cost statements are new lines. Is there anyway to have it on one line? and have
a new method to make it 2 lines? e.g. std::cout << "Hello world" << std::endl;

Project changes

* Need official package manager location
