Issue: Encoding Errors with Devanagari Characters - Unable to Convert Unicode Character U+094B to UTF-8

Description: When attempting to display the Unicode string "योग.ved" in zsh/powershell/cmd terminals, it appears as "य"ोग".

Troubleshooting:

The octal representation of UTF-8 encoding for each character:

\340\244\257 corresponds to "य" (U+092F)
\340\245\213 corresponds to "ो" (U+094B)
\340\244\227 corresponds to "ग" (U+0917)

UTF-8 encoding for character "ो" (U+094B) is incorrect.

Question: How to fix in zsh (for MacOS/Linux) and PowerShell (for Windows) terminals?
