* Put down in documentation how muchtab indentation to use e.g. 1 space or 2 spaces
* Upload my function example in documentation
* Need official package manager location
* Possibly put down what it’s built on e.g. Rust, and if it can include cargo or if it can be extended (or have embedded rust/lua etc, code)
* Can we interface with system
* is man the same as auto in c++, or let? it says there are 3 data types, but they are all the same "man"
* Can you have a variable in a string e.g. वद("परिणामः " + अ)
* By default all cout vada cost statements are new lines. Is there anyway to have it on one line?
* Footer in documentation says Devloped. It should say “Developed”
